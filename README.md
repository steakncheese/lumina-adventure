## Tips on playing the game:

1. Every action uses curl. So if you want to move north, the instructions say /w. It means to type out curl localhost:4000/w to go north.

2. To prevent typing curls over and over again, press up on your terminal so it displays your previous command.

3. Because you have read this readme, I will give you a cheat code. Type /teleport to go back on your original location.

## How to play the game:

Instructions: To move, type /w North, /s South, /a West, or /d East then press Enter.

To see info on current location: /o or observe

**_ Recommendation: Use /o in every tile you go _**

To see where you are located: /lor /location

To attack an enemy: /k or attack

The other things you must learn as you go. For it is by fire that gold is made.

Enjoy!!!
